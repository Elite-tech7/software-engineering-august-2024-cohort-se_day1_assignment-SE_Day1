b)Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Here are three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering:

ðŸ‘‰Milestone 1: The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was coined at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany. This conference recognized software development as a distinct engineering discipline, acknowledging the need for a more systematic approach to software development. This milestone marked the beginning of software engineering as a field, setting the stage for the development of methodologies, tools, and techniques.

ðŸ‘‰Milestone 2: The Waterfall Model (1970)
In 1970, Winston Royce introduced the Waterfall Model, a linear and sequential software development methodology. This model emphasized a phase-by-phase approach, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one. Although the Waterfall Model has its limitations, it was a significant milestone, as it introduced a structured approach to software development, paving the way for later methodologies like Agile and Iterative Development.

ðŸ‘‰Milestone 3: The Agile Manifesto (2001)
In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was published, marking a significant shift in software engineering. Agile emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery, challenging traditional waterfall approaches. Agile's iterative and incremental approach has since become a widely accepted and influential methodology, enabling teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and deliver software faster and more reliably.
